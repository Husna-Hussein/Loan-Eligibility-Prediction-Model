<h1>Loan Eligibility Prediction Model</h1>
<p>This loan eligibility prediction model is built with scikit-learn using Random Forest classifiers to predict loan eligibility.The model takes various input features related to loan applicants (such as dependants, income, credit history, etc.) and predicts whether they are eligible for 
a loan or not.</p>
<p>The model is trained on historical loan data and uses a supervised learning approach to make predictions.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
