<h1>Loan Eligibility Prediction Model</h1>
<p>This loan eligibility prediction model uses machine learning techniques to determine whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan or not.The model takes various input features related to loan applicants (such as age, income, credit score, etc.) and predicts whether they are eligible for 
a loan or not.</p>
<p>The model is built using sklearn random forest classifiers and trained on a labeled dataset.</p>
